## Breaking API changes:

- `Environment` concept has been introduced. This allows the user to specify an endpoint (production, sandbox)
  in which to query or stream.

    - `run` (and associated functions) now take an `Environment` as the first parameter. `runSandbox` and associated
      functions have been removed.
    - `runWithManager` now has different parameter ordering. Signature is `runWithManager :: Manager -> Environment -> ClientM a -> IO a`
    - `runCbAuthT` now takes a `Runner a`, where `Runner a = ClientM a -> IO a`; allows users to specify an environment in which to run

- `placeOrder` now has `Maybe ClientOrderId` as the first parameter that allows users to assign `client_oid` to
  submitted orders. The `client_oid` field is visible on the `Full` channel.

- `CoinbasePro.WebSocketFeed.subscribeToFeed` has two additional parameters:

    - `Environment`
    - `Maybe CoinbaseProCredentials`: allows users to authenticate on subscription. See `User`

- Moved `UserId` and `ProfileId` to `CoinbasePro.Types` from `CoinbasePro.WebSocketFeed.Channel.Full.Activate`

## Additional Features:

- Added `User` channel functionality that allows users to see `user_id` and `profile_id` on messages that pertain to the subscriber.
  See [documentation](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/#the-user-channel) for more details

    - `user_id` and `profile_id` fields are now parsed from `Full` channel messages if available.

- `CoinbasePro.Types.ClientOrderId` has been introduced to specify `client_oid` in `placeOrder` API request.
  - `client_oid` is now parsed from `CoinbasePro.WebSocketFeed.Channel.Full.Received.

- `CoinbasePro.Authenticated.getOrder` allows users to query status of order

- `CoinbasePro.Authenticated.getClientOrder` allows users to query status of order using `client_oid`
