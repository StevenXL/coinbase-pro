## Request API

### Market Data Requests

```haskell
run Sandbox (trades (ProductId "BTC-USD")) >>= print
```

### Authenticated Private Requests

```haskell
runCbAuthT Sandbox cpc $ do
    fills (Just btcusd) Nothing >>= liftIO . print
  where
    accessKey  = CBAccessKey "<access-key>"
    secretKey  = CBSecretKey "<secret-key>"
    passphrase = CBAccessPassphrase "<passphrase>"
    cpc        = CoinbaseProCredentials accessKey secretKey passphrase
```

## Websocket API

To print out all of the full order book updates for BTC-USD:


```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    msgs <- subscribeToFeed [ProductId "BTC-USD"] [Ticker] Nothing
    forever $ Streams.read msgs >>= print
```

## Example

Example execs can be found in `src/example/`

### Run Example

To run any of the authenticated endpoints in `test-request`, the access key,
secret key, and passphrase must be provided. See _Authenticated Private Requests_ above.
